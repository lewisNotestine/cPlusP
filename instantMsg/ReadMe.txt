This is an "instant messenger" app that I worked on in Summer 2012 with two other PCC students as part of a Data Structures class; it uses UDP protocol, a few different threads.  We had the freedom to design our own data structures and were prohibited from using the STL Library as one of the requirements.

This one will probably only run on Windows because it depends on some Windows System DLLs to requires a few linked DLLs to run (which are linked from the "socketUDPComm.h" file which was given by instructor), which I haven't put on GitHub, but if anyone wants them I can dig them upâ€¦

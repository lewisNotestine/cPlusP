This is my C++ portfolio from much of my student work, and also includes some of the code I've written for the Arduino microcontroller.  

<h2>Arduino Microcontroller</h2>
The Arduino work is in the `SolderingController` folder and consists of a PID algorithm designed to drive a SSR-controlled heatgun to hit a temperature-with-respect-to-time target, the goal of which is to fix my PlayStation 3.  You can check out a picture of the hardware setup <a href="http://lewisnotes.com/heatgunsetup.jpg">here</a>.

Am still working on getting the algorithm right and will have to put this through several tests, but I intend to use it to do a reball operation for the unit's CPU and GPU.  It has been more expenditure in money and time than replacing the unit, but it's all part of the learning process.

<h2>Student Work</h2>
All other folders here are student work, and are posted with instructor permission (DON'T use this to cheat on your computer science homework!).  These are your basic problems involving data structures, reference handling, and all that other good stuff in C++.
